    <p>For every installed C.M.I. (usually only once) configure here the necessary parameters.</p>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <ol class="node-ports">
        <dl class="message-properties">
            <dt>Description</dt>
            <dd>Use a name that clearly describes the C.M.I. You need every C.M.I. to be created here <b>only once</b>. This means that normally it is sufficient to create a single configuration.</dd>
            
            <dt>IP-Address</dt>
            <dd>You can also use the host name instead of the IP address. If you are using the IP address, it is recommended to use a fixed / static IP address. </dd>

            <dt>Username</dt>
            <dd>Use the account that you entered in the C.M.I. as the username in 'Settings' - 'Passwords' - 'Expert'. <b>You must use the data from the 'Expert' account.</b> The user or guest account does not work. Please note this is case sensitive!</dd>

            <dt>Password</dt>
            <dd>Enter the password for the corresponding user.</dd>

            <dt>CAN Node</dt>
            <dd>Enter the CAN node number of the device that is to be queried via the C.M.I. This is usually the node number of the controller from which the data is to be obtained.</dd>

            <dt>Interval</dt>
            <dd>This polling interval defines how long the node will wait between two polls of the C.M.I.
            <dd><em>The minimum is one minute and is determined by Technische Alternative RT GmbH. This is not a restriction by the node.</em></dd>
            <dd>If you save several configurations to connect several controllers with one C.M.I. (e.g. a UVR16x2 and a RSM610) you must set 2 minutes as the polling interval for both configurations, so that the 1-minute polling interval of the TA is not exceeded.</dd>
            <dd>For information: After deployment, the data of the first device (in the example the UVR16x2) is queried and the timer for the next query is set to 2 minutes. Then there is a one minute wait and then the second device (the RSM610) is queried and the timer for the next query is also set to 2 minutes. The two devices are then queried alternately, one minute the first device, the next the second, then the first again and so on.</dd>
